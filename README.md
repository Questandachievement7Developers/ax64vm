## Installation
1. Install the `git` package in Termux:

   ```shell
   $ pkg install git
   ```
2. Clone the Ax64VM repository
   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/Questandachievement7Developers/ax64vm
   ```
3. Navigate to the cloned repository
   ```shell
   $ cd ax64vm
   ```
4. Grant executable permissions to the ax64vm.sh script
   ```shell
   $ chmod +x ./ax64vm.sh
   ```
5. Run the ax64vm.sh script:
**Warning: Ensure that no other VNC server is running on port 5900.**
   ```shell
   $ ./ax64vm.sh
   ```
 6. Connect to the Ax64VM display using a VNC viewer with the address localhost:5900

## Background and Inspiration
The genesis of Ax64VM finds its roots in the inspiration drawn from the availability of iOS UTMâ€”an ingenious creation that enables the utilization of Metal for virtio-ramfb-gl, thereby empowering iOS devices to harness the full potential of OpenGL acceleration. This remarkable capability left Android, and indeed any non-Apple Silicon ARM-based device, in a state of deprivation, languishing without OpenGL acceleration. It became apparent that Android, with its vast ecosystem of devices, was in dire need of a solution.

Motivated by this disparity, Ax64VM was conceived as a transformative wrapper, transcending the limitations imposed on Android systems. It aimed to bridge the gap and deliver OpenGL acceleration to the Android platform. The journey began with an exploration of the Snapdragon 888, a flagship Android SoC known for its prowess, only to discover that it, too, fell short in providing optimal performance.

As the development of Ax64VM unfolded, a deeper understanding emerged regarding the challenges faced by Android SoC CPUs. The limitations and disparities experienced on the Snapdragon 888 and similar chipsets revealed a need for a comprehensive solution that could empower Android devices to unleash the true potential of OpenGL acceleration.

With this newfound knowledge, Ax64VM emerged as a testament to the relentless pursuit of innovation and the desire to empower the Android ecosystem. By weaving together VirGL's 3D acceleration, QEMU's virtualization capabilities, and the mystic powers of OpenGL, Ax64VM aspires to uplift Android, ensuring that devices powered by non-Apple Silicon ARM CPUs can also experience the magic of accelerated graphics.
